Semester Project: Silent Cartoon Creation using Agile Scrum Methodologies

Project Overview:
The goal of this semester project is to create a short and funny silent cartoon using Blender for 3D graphics design. The project duration is approximately 10 weeks, and it will be completed by a team of 10 beginner students. The project is divided into epics with associated tasks to ensure an agile and iterative development process.

Epic 1: Concept and Storyboarding Week 5

- Model the main characters and secondary objects required for the cartoon.
- Texture and apply materials to the 3D models.
- Rig the characters for animation.
- Create and import background environments.
- Collaboratively ensure consistency in design and style.

Epic 3: Animation Week 8-9
- Animate the characters and objects based on the storyboard.
- Add expressions, movements, and interactions to convey humor.

Epic 8: Sprint Planning and Management (Ongoing) Week 15
- Plan and schedule work for each sprint (usually one or two weeks).
- Assign tasks and responsibilities based on team members' strengths and interests.
- Hold regular stand-up meetings to track progress and address any blockers.
- Adapt and adjust the project plan as needed throughout the development.

Epic 9: Documentation and Presentation Week 16
- Document the development process, including challenges and solutions.
- Prepare a presentation for the final submission, showcasing the cartoon and discussing the use of Blender in the project.
- Ensure all necessary files and assets are organized for future reference.

Project Completion:
At the end of the project, the team(s) will have created a funny and engaging silent cartoon using Blender. The final deliverables will include the cartoon video, project documentation, and a presentation to demonstrate the use of agile Scrum methodologies in the development process.
